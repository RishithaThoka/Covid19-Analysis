# Covid19-Analysis
This repository contains the code and documentation for a COVID-19 data analysis project . The project analyzes COVID-19 data using Python libraries to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to the pandemic.
# Project Overview
The project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data, including infection rates, mortality rates, and the impact of mitigation measures. It employs statistical techniques like linear regression and data visualization tools to derive insights. Key objectives include:
- Identifying correlations and predictive models using linear regression.
- Preprocessing and manipulating data with Pandas.
- Creating visualizations with Matplotlib and Plotly.
- Conducting a meta-analysis on vaccine effectiveness.
- The dataset includes global COVID-19 data, with specific analyses for countries like India, Germany, Japan, Ghana, and the UK. Visualizations cover confirmed cases, deaths, vaccinations, and more.
# Repository Structure

# Prerequisites
To run the code, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
  - pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly scikit-learn requests
- Microsoft Excel (for handling .xlsx files)
# Usage
- Data Analysis: The Jupyter Notebook contains code for data preprocessing, linear regression, and visualization. Modify the code to analyze different datasets or variables.
- Visualizations: Outputs include bar graphs, pie charts, and scatter plots for various metrics (e.g., total cases, deaths, vaccinations).
- Meta-Analysis: Review the report for details on vaccine effectiveness analysis.
# Results
Key findings include:
- Significant regional variations in infection rates, influenced by demographics like age and population density.
- Effectiveness of mitigation measures (e.g., social distancing, masks, vaccinations) in reducing transmission.
- Vaccines significantly reduced cases, hospitalizations, and mortality.
- See the Report.pdf for detailed results and conclusions.
